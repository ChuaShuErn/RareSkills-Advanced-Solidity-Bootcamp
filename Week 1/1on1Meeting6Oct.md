1. Emit events for Important Functions and state changes
2. Get rid of "^" when defining pragma solidity for your own contracts
3. Use Ownable2Step
4. Consider the Before Token Transfer Hook by OpenZepplin (RE: SanctionableToken)
5. For numbers, use 1_000_000 instead of 1000000. It is valid Solidity
