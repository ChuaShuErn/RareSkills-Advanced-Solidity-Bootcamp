- [ ] **Question 1:** The OZ upgrade tool for hardhat defends against 6 kinds of mistakes. What are they and why do they matter?
- [ ] **Question 2:** What is a beacon proxy used for?
- [ ] **Question 3:** Why does the openzeppelin upgradeable tool insert something like `uint256[50] private __gap;` inside the contracts? To see it, create an upgradeable smart contract that has a parent contract and look in the parent.
- [ ] **Question 4:** What is the difference between initializing the proxy and initializing the implementation? Do you need to do both? When do they need to be done?
- [ ] **Question 5:** What is the use for the [reinitializer](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/master/contracts/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol#L119)? Provide a minimal example of proper use in Solidity
